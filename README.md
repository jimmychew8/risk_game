# risk_game

Simulates the roll of the die for a risk game. The first argument is the number of attacking players. The second the number of defending players. This program will continue on until all defenders have been killed or all but one attacker is left. (So don't use this if you want to quit attacking half way). 

Requirements: Python 2.7 and bad luck rolling.. and a desire to try this out.

Sample run: 
python risk.py 10 8
